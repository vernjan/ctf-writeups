*Hint: count quavers, read semibreves*

*Once you found the solution, enter it in the egg-o-matic below. Uppercase only, and no spaces!*

Being a total musical analphabet, I was not looking forward to this one. For no reason though!

I started with a few YouTube (**TODO links**) videos to learn what the hell are *quavers* and *semibreves*.

Now it's actually quite simple, just follow the hint:

Count the number of *quavers* in each [barline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music) and read the pitch
(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) of *quavers*.
