# Downloaded file

Hi, executive senior investigator!

The file, you have acquired in previous investigation is not the malware, we were looking for. The attacker probably replaced it to fool us. Fortunatelly, we have a traffic dump, where you can probably find the original file. Try to find it and do not forget to be sure it is the correct file.

Use password `ThE-doWNloAdeD-fIlE-20` to [download the evidence](downloaded_file.zip)

Good luck!
