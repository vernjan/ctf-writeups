# Ransomware

Hi, executive senior investigator!

Finally, we have acquired the `RANSOMVID-20` encryption module. According to the information from our partners, it encrypts files on any drives, it can found. We have also one image of relatively small drive, which was affected by `RANSOMVID-20` only (no user or system action were undertaken). Try to find out how to decrypt the files without paying any single TCC.

Use password `rAnSOmVID-20` to [download the evidence](ransomware.zip)

Good luck!

**WARNING: The ransomware executable is dangerous - virtual machine is strongly recommended for the analysis.**

Download and unzip the evidence (**in a virtual machine**):
