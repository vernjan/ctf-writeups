# Malware spreading

Hi, executive senior investigator!

We suspect that the malware is primarily spreaded somehow by e-mail. We have partial traffic dump from one small company, that was attacked. Try to check this hypothesis.

Use password `ThE-MaLWr-MaIlZZz-20` to [download the evidence](malware_spreading.zip)

Good Luck!

Download and unzip the evidence:

```
$ ls
malware_spreading.pcap
malware_spreading.pcap.md5
```

This challenge is quite similar to [Spam everywhere](../../01-training-ground/02-spam-everywhere/README.md).

Open the PCAP file in _Wireshark_ and, again, export all the email messages.

Reading through the emails, one of the conversations is really suspicious:

> Dear customer,
I'm IT specialist in The Nation Lottery and I have an exciting offer for you! I can tell you in advance which numbers will be drawn!
>
> I can't win it myself, because it will be very suspicious. I will tell you the secret if you promise to give me 30 % of the prize. I trust you, so no payment in advance, no credit cards or other deceptions.

The attachment is [winning_numbers.zip](winning_numbers.zip).
However, the archive is password protected. Let's read on.

Now we have the password `HappyWinner-paSSw00rd42`. Unzip the archive. 
There is [nation_lottery_numbers.ods](nation_lottery_numbers.ods).

Open the document in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)
and either allow the macros:

![](office-macro.png)

Or check the macros source code in _Tools_ / _Macros_:

```
Sub Main
	MsgBox("Your numbers: FLAG{rUn5-GwMR-IlY6-orZd}", MB_OK + MB_ICONEXCLAMATION)
	thisComponent.close(true)
end sub
```

The flag is `FLAG{rUn5-GwMR-IlY6-orZd}`
