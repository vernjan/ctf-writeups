# Malware spreading

Hi, executive senior investigator!

We suspect that the malware is primarily spreaded somehow by e-mail. We have partial traffic dump from one small company, that was attacked. Try to check this hypothesis.

Use password `ThE-MaLWr-MaIlZZz-20` to [download the evidence](malware_spreading.zip)

Good Luck!
