# Spam everywhere

Hi, junior investigator!

We get some recorded traffic, we believe you can analyze it and found whether it contains something malicious.

Use password `sPaMMerS-wOrKS` to [download the evidence](spam_everywhere.zip)

Good Luck!

Download and unzip the evidence:

```
$ ls
spam_everywhere.pcap
spam_everywhere.pcap.md5
```

We have a [PCAP file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/pcap) here which means it's time for [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

Open the file in _Wireshark_ and do some basic analysis.
