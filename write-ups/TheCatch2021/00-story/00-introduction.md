# Introduction

Hi Expert,

we have a job for you that cannot be rejected. A team of archaeologist need some kind of assistence in their research of lost civilization. According to the first unconfirmed report, the investigated civilization magically disappeared in first half of 21. century, but the reason is still unknown - maybe they didn't use IPv6, maybe they didn't have a CSIRT, maybe they failed to implement ISMS, maybe ... who knows?

What is important - the archaelogist have found some of IT equipment still running and they need your help with IT-related tasks. At first, you should gain the trust of the archaeologists in ITATC (Information Technology Archaelogist Training Camp). If you accept this job (and we trust you do), please enter the code `FLAG{E6Ou-Zzz9-zLHY-dWNi}` which will bring you to ITATC.

See you there!
