# Introduction

Hi, promising candidate, welcome to Mysterious Delivery Ltd., our company is very progressive, inovative, and based on artificial intelligence. Our CO2 and C2H5OH footprints are not just zero, but downright negative! We deliver all over Europe and once even took a shipment to the moon.

Well, some annoying issues have occurred recently – for example, some packets were lost during transportation. The most critical situation is in Prague, where nearly all packet were not delivered and some internal systems do not work properly. Unfortunately, the AI just indicates that it has no idea what is happening!

It looks like we need some natural intelligence – yours! First, you have to prove that you are enough skilled for working position `Packet Inspector`. If you are interested, please enter the applicant code `FLAG{MfNG-o1iq-w1wV-rQB1}`.
