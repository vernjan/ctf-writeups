# Fraudulent e-mail

Hi, packet inspector,

we have a apparently problem with some fraudulent payment gateway (see forwarded e-mail). We suspect that many of our
customers have come across this scam.

Identifify all card numbers entered into the fraudulent webpage (we have to report incident and its details to
CSIRT-TCC).

May the Packet be with you!
