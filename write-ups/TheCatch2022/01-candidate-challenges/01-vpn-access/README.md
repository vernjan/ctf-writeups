# VPN access

Hi, promising candidate,

a lot of internal system is accessible only via VPN. You have to install and configure OpenVPN properly. Configuration
file can be downloaded from CTFd's link VPN. Activate VPN and visit testing
page http://candidate-test.mysterious-delivery.tcc, where the control code is.

May the Packet be with you!

The first challenge is easy. Just install [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/), import the config, connect and visit
http://candidate-test.mysterious-delivery.tcc/.
