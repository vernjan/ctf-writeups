# Bitcoin wallet

Hi, promising candidate,

our customers paying by bitcoin to our wallet `bc1q8vnufzpyurlnvrxavrn2vxe5z0nafrp2d8nzng` can get their package pickup
code on http://pay-check.mysterious-delivery.thecatch.cz by entering their wallet ID.

Find out the pickup code for package that has not yet been claimed, although it was already paid for on Aug 8th 2022.

May the Packet be with you!
