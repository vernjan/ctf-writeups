Let's try [Caesar cihper](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher):
```
Verse 3 done! Off with you! Get back to work! You're not done here...
```

Apply the same ROT+23 to the second part of the message (the **Q**uick **R**esponse).
See [qr-decrypted](qr-decrypted).

Decode from base64:
```
$ cat qr-decrypted | base64 -d > qr.png
```

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact, the original verse 3 is:
```
On the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Three french hens
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree
```
