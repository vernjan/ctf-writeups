# HV20.16 Naughty Rudolph

_Santa loves to keep his personal secrets on a little toy cube he got from a kid called Bread. Turns out that was not a very good idea. Last night Rudolph got hold of it and frubl'd it about five times before spitting it out. Look at it! All the colors have come off! Naughty Rudolph!_
