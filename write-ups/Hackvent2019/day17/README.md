The important staff is hidden under the _source_ tab:

Obviously, the use of `UPPER` and `LOWER` case conversions make no real sense here. Also, the whole
site is about Unicode so I focused on that. I registered a new user named `hell☃`.  It worked.

But how come that the name I see on the screen is not UPPER cased?

The next thing I tried is how the site cache_items [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic).
Being a Czech was kinda an advantage here, we use diacritics in half of the words :-) So I tried
to register one more user named `Včela`. It worked again. The name was, however, still displayed
in the original case..

So I tried to login as `VČELA` and `včela` and all worked. Then I tried `vcela`. Worked. Ok, now I
get it. All usernames are stored in UPPER case and stripped from diacritics (the side
effect of UPPER conversion with an inappropriate collation) but being displayed as typed into the login
form.

I registered the user named `sanťa` with password `qqq`. According to the source code, this should
override the password for real `santa`. I logged in as `santa` with password `qqq` and grabbed
the flag.

The flag is `HV19{h4v1ng_fun_w1th_un1c0d3}`
